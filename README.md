# Xerox
A launcher/bootstrapper I dont really know (mainly made for me for a quick template in game jams but If other ppl want to use it thats why I published it)

# About!
I don't know what to really call it, but its mainly a launcher where you press one button, and as long as you have git installed it will copy a game template to the root folder of the project. And in the future I also want to add a button where you can put in a repository of your choice and it will automatically copy it.
